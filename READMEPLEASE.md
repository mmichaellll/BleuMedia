make sure you have videos that are like around 1mb, because edstem has very small storage, there is a zip 
(https://standrewscs-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/mpearce25_student_sacs_nsw_edu_au/Eba6UlH1xvBGl4aBOir2Rs8B1YZRuLrGNVerm3YcJORCWw?e=fXkPhK)
the videos are some test sample ones i found online, i duplicated a couple for testing stuff.
you can use these if you want, make sure if you don't, that you use pretty small videos 

also make sure to run it (obvs) and itll generate the db file, if it messes up just delete the db and regen using the app.py 

hope my project is good!!! (do not steal my api key !! thanks!!)

(if there is a size error - just delete the uploads folder (which contains the thumbnails folder) it will recreate itself + delete db too
because it will bug out about user_id, and be weird so reset cookies too if something happens
or just delete files from the library/dashboard too that works (hopefullyðŸ¤žðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž))
